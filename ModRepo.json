      "description": "**0.95a Ship Bounds Redone 1.0**\nRedos some of the worse ship hitboxes in the game, with a particular focus on reducing the amount of unnecessary vertices, especially for fighters. This should give you a marginal performance boost in big battles with lots of fighters but no guarantee.\n\nThis mod will not work with anything that changes the vanilla ship files(f.e. Archean Order), as it itself changes vanilla ship files. Please use with caution.\n\nDownload: https://github.com/MrFluffster/boundsRedone/releases/download/1.0/boundsRedone.zip",

Ping someone who looks active before pinging all, please.\n- Include the mod name, a short description, the version, and the download link.\n- Include a changelog, whether it is ok to add to an existing save, whether the update is save-compatible, a forum link, source code link, and an image.\n- Keep the post reasonably short. Use only highlights from a changelog and pare down the description.\n- Add an image/gif to showcase your mod; it will make people more likely to download it if they can see what they're getting into.\n- Compress your mod to a `.zip` (recommended because of native support on all systems) and host it somewhere (GitHub, BitBucket, GDrive, Patreon, etc).\n- Tip: write in a text editor instead of Discord to avoid accidental sending/deletion, then copy/paste to Discord.\n- Tip: when adding a new version, edit your old post, copy it, then paste it and modify it to make the new post.\n- Tip: wrapping a link with `<` and `>` will tell Discord not to attach a link preview.\n\nSuggested Starter Template\n```\n__**Onslaught of Onslaughts 1.0.0**__\nAdds 200 Onslaught reskins and over 500 Onslaught-related loading screen tips.\nSafe to add to saves and safe to update on the same save (save-compatible).\n\n\\`\\`\\` (without the 3 \\, only the `)\nAdded\n- 10 more Onslaught reskins\n\nModified\n- Phase-slaughts now use mine system.\n\nFixed\n- Switched on Offslaught.\n\\`\\`\\`\n\ndownload: <https://example.com/onslaught-of-onslaughts-1.0.0.zip>\nforum: <https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=00000>\nsource code: <https://github.com/example/ooo>\n```",

Also has some bugfixes.\n\nIn this version: The bug that would not die has been squished! Tragically, **your saves have been consigned to oblivion**. As far as I know, this leaves no more outstanding bugs, so I won't be working on this any more.\nAs always, if you *do* find a bug, please ping me. Vayra has ventured to a far-off land on a journey of self-discovery, and we do not know when she will return to grant her blessing to this land.\n\nDownload here: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1EMhXdh4b24i5a8-yzceV4kenALGNcK79",

They are now also displayed \"naked\" in refit.\n - All the rare-but-not-unique bounties now have much spicier loadouts.\n - All bounty captains now have better suited skills.\n - Many ship descriptions got a much needed polish pass.\n - Made all the plague-bearer encounters approximatively 267% audio-visually more impressive.```\n\n**Download:** <https://www.patreon.com/posts/61242196>\n\n**Forum:** <http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=19414.0>\n**Nexus:** <https://www.nexusmods.com/starsector/mods/50?tab=files>\n**MagicLab discord:** <https://discord.gg/tK3JWBbQ>\n**Bug report/feedback:** <https://forms.gle/YbQ8cYUA5QaJBCYV8>",

For each weapon group, you can select a fire mode (e.g. AvoidShields) and a suffix (e.g. HoldFire when Flux > 75%) to customise how that group should behave. Also features basic ship modes (e.g. LowerShields when Flux > 50%) and a ~~badly~~ expertly done GUI.\nCan be added/removed to/from an ongoing campaign.\n\nRelevant new features in 0.11.0: Lots of bugfixes for the custom targeting AI, rework of target/avoidShields modes (now consider shield flanking)\n\nNew features in 0.12.0: GUI polish, ability to load suggested weapon modes. \nNote for faction/content extension mod authors: You can now add suggested modes/suffixes for your weapons in modSettings.json (refer to https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control/blob/devel2/data/config/modSettings.json for an example)\n\nFeedback is much appreciated, especially on the pre-release version.\nThanks and happy gaming/modding!",

Some I made up, a bunch are from books and other media, and a ton are from people in the community.\n\nAdded a ton of names that I was too busy to deal with before and a number of loading tips split between humorous and serious (actual, real, useful) tips.\n\nAnyway DM me if you have any good names or loading tips! If I like em they'll go in and you'll get credit.\n\nIf you see anything wrong, please please let me know so I can correct it right away.\n\nAlso, some of the tips I added are silly, so if they bother you you can delete the tips file in baracks name lists/data/strings.\n\nAnd here is the XIV Ziggy HVB, lovingly handcrafted by Juan Dela Cruz and myself:\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1mNLrv3u5rD3lWXsnPJfuWC7bU0AimyJL/view?usp=sharing",

For starter I recommending the Safe pack but if you trust your high end PC to pack a punch do give Dangerous pack a go. As for people who're curious about what this do read the Documentation.txt included on each pack.\n\nKnown issues\n```\n- Due to how the mod works, the game may show \"Memory Leak! Campaign Duplicates\" over time. This is okay!\n\n- However if one of your mod list does have a memory leak.. this mod may fail to clean extra copies.\n```\n\nFully save compatible! If the game doesn't launch after you replace the `vmparam` and you're using JRE8 pack, make sure the `jre` folder is already swapped with JRE8!",

Ed.)**\n\nTo some the GMDA is a Robin Hood-like police organisation, stealing from the established factions and giving it to the low-down independent-leaning folks across the sector. To others, they are an exploitative mafia who reave established factions and hiding behind their false image in independent ports. Regardless of the truth, the GMDA is a persistent and annoying threat to the faction merchant, and one that disappears when stronger foes appear.\n\nChangelog\n0.9.8a\n-Added GM Health Service ships, that boost marines, reduce crew loss across the fleet, and use obscene defense shuttles.\n-Mudskipper (GMHS), Nebula (GMHS) and Starliner (GMHS).\n\n-Added GM Fire Service ships, that help salvage and speed up repairs, and are supported by strange defense fighters.\n-Shepherd (GMFS), Gemini (GMFS) and Mora (GMFS).\n-Also added GMFS weapons -  they're strange, and niche, and weird, and possibly powerful when used correctly.\n\n-Bluebottler gun is no longer a weak EMP stream weapon, it's now like a small MG thumper\n\n-Updated to 0.95.1a\n\nSavegame compatible *with previous version*, otherwise not savegame compatible.\n\nDownload here:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/King_Alfonzo/i-will-make-sindria-great-again/downloads/GrytpypeMoriarty_0_9_8a.zip",

Both organisations suffer from an obsession with gene-modding to go above conventional humanity in strength, speed, intelligence - and cruelty.\n\nThe Draco Group, aristocratic and cold, harvest populations to imbibe their blood in their hedonistic rituals, reaving on high-speed high-tech ships from the system of Prester John. The Fang Society, animalistic and vicious, prey on defenseless peoples to consume, eat and torture, roaming the sector from heavily armoured ships.\n\nWhile their hatred for the Sector is well know, their loathing for each other is even greater. It is for this reason that their impact on the Sector at large is relatively minor, as they are more content to butcher each other.\n\n*0.0.3 Changes*\n\n-Fang Society now uses ~~the Luddic Experimental~~ a completely new and novel Damper Field system as a replacement for their shield; their hullmods now give less armour and less hull to compensate.\n-Draco Group now possesses a passive EMP arc system that zaps nearby enemies, with the zapping rate increasing with rising flux. Shields now take more damage, and the range clamp to 600 units is now more severe to compensate.\n-Fang and Draco now have rudimentary Nexerellin starting options\n\n*0.0.3a*\n-Fixed the Fang CTD\n-Fixed the Draco EMP hitting friendly missiles\n\n*Savegame Compatible*\n\n\nDOWNLOAD:\nhttps://bitbucket.org/King_Alfonzo/i-will-make-sindria-great-again/downloads/HMI_Supervillains_0_0_3a.zip",

I wanted to get a crash hotfix regarding a naming mismatch out tonight so the increased threat release has not been fully tested during a complete game. They seemed to be more aggressive and everything should go as planned but yea you know how that goes. Please let me know if you feel I over tuned them.\n\n**Download:** https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qU06YXnPXJTxbPrVG5A1EHWiiqyxk7mP/view?usp=sharing",

That's fixed now. I also added tooltips, so now you'll actually know what the version of the available update is - and what the pretty colours actually mean.\n\n- **New:**\n  - Version information tooltips\n    - Tooltips appear when you hover over the icons in the `Version` column\n    - Tooltips detail what type of update is available (`Major`, `Minor`, etc) and the version number of the update\n- **Fixed:**\n  - Selecting \"overwrite\" in the update/overwrite dialogue should now correctly perform an overwrite\n  - There were some other cases where a similar issue was present, but I hadn't had reports/actually reproduced them myself\n\n**Notable Previous Changes:**\n- **New**\n  - Duplicate mod detection\n    - Presents a new modal window when duplicate mod installs are detected\n    - The modal will include a list of all known duplicate mods. \n    - Each entry will present details about the duplicates, including their version, path, last modification date and creation date\n  - Overwrite requests are now grouped into a single window, preventing new window spam when updating many mods at once\n    - You may need to scroll the window to view all updates/conflicts, but \"Overwrite All\" and \"Cancel All\" are provided for convenience\n- **Fixes**\n  - All modals (logs, overwrite requests, etc) now scroll their contents instead of it going out of view\n  - Updates/overwrites now preserve enable state in the UI (enable state was still set correctly in enabled.json)\n\n||To download, open the `Download` link, then open the assets folder/accordion/thing and pick your platform||\n\n**Download**: <https://github.com/atlanticaccent/starsector-mod-manager-rust/releases/tag/0.6.2>\n**Sources**: <https://github.com/atlanticaccent/starsector-mod-manager-rust>\n**Forum**: <https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21995.0>",

      "description": "**OOP! ALL VARIANTS (1.1.0) (A Ship/Weapon Pack Submod)**\n\n**1.1.0 Isn't savegame compatible with the 1.0.0 release.**\n\nFalcon (Lion Guard)\nStriker (XIV battlegroup)\nLiberator (XIV battlegroup)\nVindicator (XIV battlegroup)\n\nAll of these ships can be acquired via their faction blueprints, (Falcon via the Lion Guard blueprint, Striker, Liberator, and Vindicator via XIV battlegroup blueprint) or on the open market (hopefully)\n\n```\nVersion 1.1.0 (23/02/22)\n- Added variants to all ships from this mod for the AI to use. Totally didn't just copy the non-Lion Guard or non-XIV variants and tweak it slightly (I totally did, I'm not good at this) Turns out the AI needs these. I definitely totally didn't not know this.\n\n- Added the Striker XIV, Liberator XIVs, Vindicator XIV, and the Falcon Lion Guard ships to their respective faction spawn pools. Turns out they need those. I made them about 50% more rare than their non-specialized counterparts. The only exception is the Lion Guard Falcon, which is about as common as the Lion Guard Eagle from the base SWP mod. Let me know if any ship seems to be spawning too much or too little.\n\n```\n\n**NOTE**\nThis mod requires Ship/Weapon Pack to work!\n\nAdded download link after posting because am stupid:\n\nhttps://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=24151.0",

All I did was a mod to starsector that adds the carrier with 7 (playable at least once) mechs from their original universe.\n\nWhat does the mod do? - Adds a small content expansion with a quest, a one-of-a-kind ship carrying 7 one-of-a-kind fighters and a new boss battle. \n\nIs it safe to add to ongoing saves? - Yes, but removing it afterwards is not.\n\nI got the mod, but I can't find a clue about the ship. What happened? - The NPC that triggers the mission can only appear about a cycle after the starting date of the game. If you activated the mod in an ongoing playthrough where that much time or more has passed, the quest can be started immediately.\n\nforums: <https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=24274.0>",

      "description": "**Truly Automated Ships v1.2.1**\n\nThis mod intends to change the way AI officers assigned to automated ships affect the rest of your fleet.\n\nThis mod makes it more viable to have powerful automated fleets. It's possible, for example, to have up to three Radiants in your fleet without suffering any CR maluses. The drawback is an increase in the amount monthly supplies required to keep your ships operational. You'll really have to think about how much increasing the power of a given ship is worth to you.\n\nThis mod applies a reduction to the \"automated ship points\" of any ship outfitted with an AI officer, depenging on the type of core.\nHaving an AI core as an officer also causes a hefty increase to its monthly supply cost, reflecting the huge amount of resources required to run an AI core in the first place.\n\nPlease let me know what you think of the numbers. I'm open to tinkering with them to find out which values feel the best to play with.\n\nv1.2.1 changelog\n```\n- Fixed compatibility issue with Seeker (TAS now only affects ships in the player's fleet)\n```\n\nv1.2 changelog:\n```\n- Updated values and calculations to adapt to patch 0.95.1a-RC6\n- Added a modifier to AP reduction based on hull size (sorry, running 12 Radiants per fleet would've been a bit too much)\n- Added settings file for customisation\n```\n\nForum page: https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=21547.0",

While slow and weakly armoured, it does possess a basic shield, and a Phase Skinner for both defense and mobility.\n> The Sphyrnidae-class Cruiser focuses on close-range brawling. A combination of a Flux Shunt and Unstable Containment Fields lets the Sphyrnidae excel despite the normal weaknesses associated with a shield-focused ship at close quarters.\n\n> The Steve-class frieghter is a more armoured version of the Buffalo, designed for a more hostile sector. A Burn Drive and Damper Field allows it to escape pursuit when needed, while a shielded cargo hold helps avert attacks in the first place.\n> The Tiwaz-class Capital is the little brother to the Onslaught. While it lacks the signature Thermal Pulse Cannons, it possesses a higher level of integration than most ships in existence.\n> The Offensive-class Onslaught, in contrast, is a bigger, beefier Onslaught. Much of its bulk is dedicated to its pair of Thermal Pulse Accelerators, allowing it to fire faster and hit harder. It's ship system also received adjustments, being replaced with Manuevering Jets to bring its main weapons on-target quicker.\n\n*Available at: https://www.patreon.com/posts/mod-links-60097706*",
